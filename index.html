					<p>
					
		
This is a collaborative project with <strong>
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/prince-krampah-5a2b921bb/">Prince Kramph</a></strong>.




In this project we delved into data exploration using <b>MySQL</b> to extract insights to help the management to revamp their existing sales strategies 
for optimal gains.
						
The dataset used for this project can be found in my github repository 
<strong><a href="https://github.com/Adeola-16/Project/blob/main/WalmartSalesData.csv">WalmartSalesData</a></strong>.

					
The dataset contains sales transactions from three different branches of Walmart, respectively located in Mandalay, Yangon and Naypyitaw. 
						
The data contains 17 columns and 1000 rows.

	<h3 class="major">Customer Experience with a Travel Company</h3>
<p>

	In this project, I examined a travel company that is seeking to make customer experience an amazing and unforgettable one. 
	My approach was to gather information about the needs of the customers, their preferences and behaviours through the use of a questionnaire (google form).
								
	The information gotten was analysed using my knowledge of data cleaning, pivot-table, and data visualization to gain insights into what the customers 
	want from a travel experience.
	My findings and recommendations were forwarded to the management of the travel company to enable them design services that are tailored to the needs
	of their customers.

<!--Project Product and Manufacturing-->

<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1N1Q7F-SNGldk0WGALO_Nyq-KcA3MLM7n/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=100934301220907311928&rtpof=true&sd=true"
	
	class="image"><img src="images/Superstore Image.webp" alt="" /></a>
	<h3 class="major">Bikes, Clothing, and Accessories Company</h3>
	<p>
		
		This project is about a superstore, that is ranked as one of the world’s largest suppliers of Bikes, clothing 
and accessories with over 2,000 retail stores across different countries worldwide. 

despite the brand’s global presence and success, the company was faced with over reliance on one product which is 
detrimental to the continuous existence of the company. 

As a data-analyst, I was contracted to join the Welup Digital Team as an Intern to carry out a 
thorough analysis of the dataset provided and come-up with a dynamic interactive dashboard, insights, 
and recommendations on how to improve the conditions of the company and drive growth across all the regions where the store exits.
