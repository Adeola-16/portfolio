						from large datasets, and presented my findings and recommendations to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

											<h3 class="major">Malaria Deaths Cases</h3>
											<p>
												
								Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by Plasmodium parasites that are transmitted to humans through 
								the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. Despite global efforts to control and eliminate the disease,
								malaria remains a significant public health challenge, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, where most malaria 
								cases and deaths occur.
								Malaria can cause a range of symptoms, including fever, chills, headache, and muscle pain, and if left untreated,
								can lead to severe complications, including anaemia, respiratory distress, organ failure, and death.

											<h3 class="major">Customer Experience with a Travel Company</h3>

											<p>

								
								
						In this project, I examined a travel company that is seeking to make customer experience an amazing and unforgettable one. 
						My approach was to gather information about the needs of the customers, their preferences and behaviours through the use
						of google form.
																		
						The information gotten was analysed using my knowledge of data cleaning, pivot-table, and data visualization to gain 
						insights into what the customers want from a travel experience.
						My findings and recommendations were presented to both the technical and non-technical management team and these
						enabled them to design services that are tailored to the needs of their customers.

					In this project, I was given the task to analyse a-3 year sales datasets in one of the fast-growing product manufacturing and
					distribution companies, and make a presentation of my findings to the management based on:
					the revenue generated for the period; the most productive sales person for the company; recommendation to increase revenue
